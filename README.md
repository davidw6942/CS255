In CS 255 we went through the DriverPass project. DriverPass was the client and they wanted to design a web based system that allowed customers to sign up for packages to learn to drive better. I felt I captured the requirements very well in project one. I would choose to improve the seond project with the multiple use case diagrams. I feel they could have been more detailed and that I need to get better with creating the diagrams as a whole. I started with identifying what the user needs were, and then incorporating those into the system design. It's important to not only hear the needs but to also understand them. Some things may not make sense but are there for a reason. We must consider user needs because the client needs to sign off on the design. If they don't like the design they could choose to go with someone else to create what they want. This could give you a bad reputation and you could lose potential opportunities in the future. I feel the course was very good in teaching how to approach the design process and implementing those designs. I will most definitely be using diagrams more in the future because they gave me a visual idea of what I wanted for the design and helped me keep track of the requirements from the client.
